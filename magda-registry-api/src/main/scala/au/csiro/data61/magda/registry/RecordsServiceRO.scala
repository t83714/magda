   * @apiGroup Registry Record Service
   * @api {get} /v0/registry/records Get a list of all records
   *
   * @apiDescription Get a list of all records
   * @apiParam (query) {string[]} aspect The aspects for which to retrieve data, specified as multiple occurrences of this query parameter. Only records that have all of these aspects will be included in the response.
   * @apiParam (query) {string[]} optionalAspect The optional aspects for which to retrieve data, specified as multiple occurrences of this query parameter. These aspects will be included in a record if available, but a record will be included even if it is missing these aspects.
   * @apiParam (query) {string} pageToken A token that identifies the start of a page of results. This token should not be interpreted as having any meaning, but it can be obtained from a previous page of results.
   * @apiParam (query) {number} start The index of the first record to retrieve. When possible, specify pageToken instead as it will result in better performance. If this parameter and pageToken are both specified, this parameter is interpreted as the index after the pageToken of the first record to retrieve.
   * @apiParam (query) {number} limit The maximum number of records to receive. The response will include a token that can be passed as the pageToken parameter to a future request to continue receiving results where this query leaves off.
   * @apiParam (query) {boolean} dereference true to automatically dereference links to other records; false to leave them as links. Dereferencing a link means including the record itself where the link would be. Dereferencing only happens one level deep, regardless of the value of this parameter.
   * @apiParam (query) {string[]} aspectQuery Filter the records returned by a value within the aspect JSON. Expressed as 'aspectId.path.to.field:valueâ€™, url encoded. NOTE: This is an early stage API and may change greatly in the future
