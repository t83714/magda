### Migrate from Magda 0.0.56 to 0.0.57

#### Background

This document provides a soluiton that migrates your existing Magda 0.0.56 deployment instance to version 0.0.57 without deleting & reinstalling your existing helm release.

> This document applies to Magda 0.0.56 instance deployed with [Magda Terraform Module](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-config/tree/master/terraform) as well because it uses [Terraform helm provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/helm/index.html) to deploy the Magda after the cluster has been prepared.

Magda 0.0.57 introduced two breaking changes to Magda helm charts:

-   Deprecated k8s APIs used in Helm charts are upgraded to support k8s Api 1.16. You can find the list of deprecated APIs removed since k8s 1.16 from [here](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/).
    -   The problem with it is that Helm recognises release objects by k8s APIs. Therefore, for example, a previous deployed `DaemonSet` under k8s API `extensions/v1beta1` in version 0.0.56 will be considered as a different object as it's now deployed through k8s API `apps/v1` in version 0.0.57. During the upgrade, helm will attempt to create another `DaemonSet` under k8s API `apps/v1` but ends up an `DaemonSet exists` error.
-   Since version 0.0.57, you can only deploy Magda with Helm 3. If you try to deploy Magda with Helm 2, you will get a `Error: apiVersion 'v2' is not valid. The value must be "v1"` error.

#### Prerequisites

> For Terraform user ONLY, if you haven't install helm 2, you should [install helm 2](https://v2-14-0.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm) before follow the instructions as The [migration script `helm_deployment_migration.sh`](./helm_deployment_migration.sh) will call helm 2 binary during the upgrade. You will need a helm 2 version that match your Terraform helm provder. If you uses [Magda's Terraform module](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-config/tree/2b7ad5aa6e0f96bc6c4228715c240950e4d331cc/terraform) to deploy magda, you should make sure helm `v2.14.3` is installed on your local machine

> The [migration script `helm_deployment_migration.sh`](./helm_deployment_migration.sh) is tested on MacOS (with bash) & [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/).

-   Prerequisites required for `helm_deployment_migration.sh`:
    -   Create `repos` directory in `Your Home Directory`: `cd ~ && mkdir repos`.
        -   We will save required `helm` & `protobuf` repos to this folder
    -   Helm 2 protobuf schema: you need to clone [helm github repo](https://github.com/helm/helm.git) to `[Your Home Directory]/repos/helm` with the following commands:
        -   `cd ~/repos`
        -   `git clone https://github.com/helm/helm.git`
    -   Protbuf base schema: you need to clone [google's protbuf github repo](https://github.com/google/protobuf) to `[Your Home Directory]/repos/protobuf` with the following commands:
        -   `cd ~/repos`
        -   `git clone https://github.com/google/protobuf`
    -   `kubectl`(Only if you haven't install one)
        -   On MacOS: `brew install kubectl`
        -   Alternatively, please refer to [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for installation instruction for your platform
    -   `protoc` binary: You can install with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (if you haven't install one)
        -   `brew install protobuf`
        -   Alternatively, you can go to `https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases` to download a release for your platform
    -   GnuSed: Required on MacOS Only. You can install it via `brew install gnu-sed`

> NOTE: You need to checkout the corresponding helm v2 branch of your tiller deployment in the helm repo that you've just cloned, e.g. v2.16.1 Otherwise the headers won't be there (they were with helm V3)

To find out your helm tiller version, you can:

```bash
helm version
```

you see the output similar to:

```bash
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.16.3", GitCommit:"1ee0254c86d4ed6887327dabed7aa7da29d7eb0d", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.16.3", GitCommit:"1ee0254c86d4ed6887327dabed7aa7da29d7eb0d", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```

Here the helm tiller version is the `Server` version: `v2.16.3`.

Go to cloned helm repos and checkout to the branch / tag matches your tiller verison:

```bash
cd ~/repos/helm`
# assume your tiller version is v2.16.3
git checkout v2.16.3
```

#### Step 1: Runs [helm_deployment_migration.sh](./helm_deployment_migration.sh) script

> Before run the script, run command `helm list` to verify your helm client can connect to the tiller correctly. The `helm list`'s output should include the release name that you're about to migrate.

-   Download the [helm_deployment_migration.sh](./helm_deployment_migration.sh) script and save it as file `helm_deployment_migration.sh` to `Your Home Directory`.
-   Make the saved file excutable: `chmod +x ~/helm_deployment_migration.sh`
-   Run helm_deployment_migration.sh:

```bash
# Go to the Home Directory where you saved the helm_deployment_migration.sh script
cd ~
# helm_deployment_migration.sh script.
# *NOTE* Here `magda` is your helm release name.
# Please replace it with your actual helm release name if you use a different name.
# If you use Magda's Terraform module, the default release name is `magda`
./helm_deployment_migration.sh magda
```

Once the script starts to run, it will show you a `git diff` screen to highlight the helm template changes that it's about to make. You can type `q` to quit the review screen and press `enter` to continue with the changes (or `ctrl-c` to abort). After that, you need to press `enter` (or `ctrl-c` to abort) to proceed with applying the change to the release data in cluster. Once it's done, the current release manifest will be fetched again and display on the screen. You will find the release only contains new k8s APIs usage now.

#### Step 2: Install [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

Follow the instruction [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install helm3.

You can also install helm 3 with brew:

```bash
brew install helm@3
```

#### Step 3: Install [Helm 2to3 Plugin](https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3)

Follow the instruction here to install Helm 2to3 Plugin:

https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3#install

#### Step 4: Migrate Helm v2 configuration

Follow the `Migrate Helm v2 configuration` instruction here:

https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3#migrate-helm-v2-configuration

#### Step 5: Convert Helm 2 Release data to Helm 3 release data in your cluster

Run the following to migrate Helm v2 release data to Helm 3

```bash
# Here `magda` is the helm release name
helm 2to3 convert magda --delete-v2-releases
```

> NOTE: --delete-v2-releases switch will delete the v2 release data after the migration. If you don't specify this switch, you will have to use `helm 2to3 cleanup --release-cleanup` to delete helm v2 release data for your release later. `helm 2to3 cleanup` command will remove all helm v2 tiller release data and you can't specify a single release name to remove.

#### Step 6: Install CRD (CustomResourceDefinition)

We need to manually install required CRD (CustomResourceDefinition) as Helm (as of v3.1.2) won't install it for you if it's upgrade installation.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magda-io/magda/master/deploy/helm/openfaas/crds/crd.yaml
```

#### Step 7: Upgrade to 0.0.57 using helm3 upgrade

Before upgrade to `0.0.57`, run `helm repo list` to make sure the repo `magda-io` (url: https://charts.magda.io) is included. If not, run

```bash
helm repo add magda-io https://charts.magda.io
```

to add the Magda helm chart repo.

Run `helm upgrade` to upgrade your release. Here is the sample command to upgrade your release to `0.0.57-0`:

```bash
helm --namespace [your magda deploy namespace] upgrade --install --timeout 9999s --wait -f [path to your config value file] magda magda --repo https://charts.magda.io --version 0.0.57-0
```

#### Step 8: Clean up Helm v2 data & Tiller

Follow the `Clean up Helm v2 data` instruction here:

https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3#clean-up-helm-v2-data
